title: Model Management
---

The NIEM model was designed to accommodate updates on a regular basis in order to adapt and evolve with user needs. [Learn more about the model here](https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/The-Model.aspx).

To incorporate change on a predictable and sustainable schedule, NIEM has implemented a release cycle for model updates. For each new release, the [NIEM Business Architecture Committee](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/nbac/Pages/default.aspx), [NIEM Technical Architecture Committee](https://www.niem.gov/meet-us/ntac/Pages/default.aspx), and [NIEM community](https://www.niem.gov/communities/Pages/communities.aspx) work together to update the model.

Individual NIEM domains manage domain updatesâ€”these can happen at any time. The updates are then incorporated into the next NIEM release (major or minor) for reconciliation and official publication. [Learn more about the NIEM release cycle here](https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/Release-Cycle.aspx).

New communities can add to the model through the NIEM domain onboarding process. [Learn more here](https://www.niem.gov/aboutniem/Pages/Domain-Onboarding.aspx).

We're currently piloting the use of Github for domain model management. Thank you to the Emergency Management community for agreeing to give this a try&mdash;you're trailblazing the way for others! To the NIEM community, please provide your feedback on what works well, what could be improved...help us make this great!
